title: "history of philosophy of science"
description: "My research has been and continues to be influenced by the thought of Paul Feyerabend, especially his views on pluralism. My work on Feyerabend has a historical dimension, understanding Feyerabend’s thought and its place within 20th century philosophy of science, and to incorporate his overlooked insights into contemporary debates in philosophy of science and science policy. I have also researched the works of Thomas Kuhn, Karl Popper, William Bartley, Arne Næss, C.S Peirce, Vannevar Bush, Pierre Duhem, John Stuart Mill, and Mary Midgley."

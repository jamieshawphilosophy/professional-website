title: "science funding policy"
description: "I am interested in political and methodological questions relating to decision-making in science funding, especially with mechanisms used to identify research promise. My focus has been on the strengths and weaknesses of peer review and the use of lotteries. More recently, I have become interested in crowdfunding, “universal research incomes” for scientists, and the inclusion of stakeholders in review processes. My primary aims are to learn how science funding policies can increase diversity and fairness in science. I am currently finishing a book entitled Science Funding Policy: A Philosophical Blueprint"

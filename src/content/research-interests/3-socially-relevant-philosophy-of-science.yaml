title: "socially relevant philosophy of science"
description: "I have consistently had a steady interest in engaging with philosophical and policy issues related to specific sciences. Regarding the environmental sciences, this has involved a focus on the implications of complexity and interconnectedness of natural ecosystems for environmental policy. More recently, my research has focused on the biomedical sciences, especially psychiatry. In particular, I have looked at ethical issues pertaining to the funding of research on “rare diseases”, the mechanisms of sponsorship bias in biomedicine, and issue at the science-policy-society interface relating to psychotherapy. This is generally informed by my more abstract work on pragmatism and pluralism."
